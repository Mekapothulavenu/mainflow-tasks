 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Task 4  

 Internship at Mainflow Services and Technology  
This repository contains the work I completed for **Task 4** during my internship in the field of **Data Science** at **Mainflow Services and Technology**.  

---

📝 Task Description  
Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset to extract insights and prepare it for further modeling or decision-making processes.  

---

🎯 Responsibilities  
1. Data Visualization  
   - Created visualizations to understand the distribution of variables.  
2. Outlier Detection  
   - Identified outliers to detect anomalies and improve data quality.  
3. Correlation Analysis  
   - Checked for relationships between variables to uncover meaningful patterns.  

---

⚙️ Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

📊 Key Insights  
- Visualized the data distribution and detected patterns.  
- Found and addressed outliers in the dataset.  
- Discovered significant correlations between key variables.
