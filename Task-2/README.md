Task 2: Data Manipulation with Pandas  

This project focuses on performing data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library. It is part of my Data Science internship at **Mainflow Services and Technologies**.  

Task Description  
This task involves using the Pandas library to manipulate and analyze data effectively. The key steps include:  
- Loading a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.  
- Filtering data based on specific conditions.  
- Handling missing values appropriately.  
- Calculating summary statistics for insights.  

Features  
- Data Loading: Importing CSV data into a structured DataFrame.  
- Data Filtering: Applying conditions to filter relevant rows.  
- Missing Value Handling: Filling or removing missing values.  
- Statistical Analysis: Computing metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.  

Requirements  
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python (>=3.7)  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive exploration)  

Install the required dependencies using:  
```bash  
pip install pandas  
```  

Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mainflow-task2.git  
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd mainflow-task2  
   ```  

3. Run the script or notebook:  
   ```bash  
   python mainflow_task2.py  
   ```  
   _OR_  
   Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook mainflow_task2.ipynb  
   ```  

Project Workflow  
1. Load Data: A CSV file is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for processing.  
2. Filter Data: Relevant rows are selected based on logical conditions.  
3. Handle Missing Values: Missing entries are imputed or removed to ensure data quality.  
4. Summary Statistics: Statistical measures are calculated to analyze the dataset.  

Example Output  
Hereâ€™s a glimpse of what the code does:  
```python  
import pandas as pd  

# Load data  
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')  

# Filter data  
filtered_df = df[df['column'] > threshold]  

# Handle missing values  
df.fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)  

# Calculate summary statistics  
stats = df.describe()  
print(stats)  
```
